# Ford Car Price Prediction 🚗💰

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is my first step into **Machine Learning**, where I used **Linear Regression** to predict **Ford car prices** based on different features (like year, mileage, model, etc.).

It’s a simple yet powerful way to understand how regression models work in real-world scenarios.
